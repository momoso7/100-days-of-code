# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 10 November 2020
**Today's Progress**: I managed to complete FreeCodeCamp's Basic HTML and Basic HTML5.

**Thoughts**: I spent almost one hour doing this task. Let's see what else I can do today.
 BTW, here is the link to my [FreeCodeCamp profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/momoso7).
 
 ### Day 2: 11 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Finished the basic CSS section of FreeCodeCamp. Try to make a basic code related to what I've studied using [sololearn](https://code.sololearn.com/WeEcPOUQyc5x/#html)'s code playground.
 
 **Thoughts**: So far, the stuffs I've learned is quite easy to understand. But to use them correctly can be a little bit tricky. Even when making this simple code, I spent a few minutes tinkering stuffs, changing the values of parameters, it's quite fun!
 
 ### Day 3: 12 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Doing the applied visual design challenges in FreeCodeCamp. Unlike yesterday's challenge, I can't finish this in one go. I also tried to make a front-end page of Google search, but it hasn't finished yet.
 
 **Thoughts**: Trying to make a front-end of a page is intersting, as there are still lot of functionalities that I haven't learnt. Most browsers today come with the inspect element tools, so I am able to see the HTML codes used by Google, but I can't simply copy them. 
 
 ### Day 4: 13 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Still working on the applied visual design challenges in FreeCodeCamp. Hopefully can finish today. It's quite interesting, how we can make some shapes like moons, hearts, and even penguin! 
 
 **Thoughts**: Starting to feel the learning curve, eh? There are rich choices of styling for html, but at the same time, it's also intimidating. I am trying to make a [chessboard](https://code.sololearn.com/WtQ3ZYCO3nDE/#html) in sololearn.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
