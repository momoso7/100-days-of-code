# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 10 November 2020
**Today's Progress**: I managed to complete FreeCodeCamp's Basic HTML and Basic HTML5.

**Thoughts**: I spent almost one hour doing this task. Let's see what else I can do today.
 BTW, here is the link to my [FreeCodeCamp profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/momoso7).

 ### Day 2: 11 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Finished the basic CSS section of FreeCodeCamp. Try to make a basic code related to what I've studied using [sololearn](https://code.sololearn.com/WeEcPOUQyc5x/#html)'s code playground.

 **Thoughts**: So far, the stuffs I've learned is quite easy to understand. But to use them correctly can be a little bit tricky. Even when making this simple code, I spent a few minutes tinkering stuffs, changing the values of parameters, it's quite fun!

 ### Day 3: 12 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Doing the applied visual design challenges in FreeCodeCamp. Unlike yesterday's challenge, I can't finish this in one go. I also tried to make a front-end page of Google search, but it hasn't finished yet.

 **Thoughts**: Trying to make a front-end of a page is intersting, as there are still lot of functionalities that I haven't learnt. Most browsers today come with the inspect element tools, so I am able to see the HTML codes used by Google, but I can't simply copy them.

 ### Day 4: 13 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Still working on the applied visual design challenges in FreeCodeCamp. Hopefully can finish today. It's quite interesting, how we can make some shapes like moons, hearts, and even penguin!

 **Thoughts**: Starting to feel the learning curve, eh? There are rich choices of styling for html, but at the same time, it's also intimidating. I am trying to make a [chessboard](https://code.sololearn.com/WtQ3ZYCO3nDE/#html) in sololearn.

 ### Day 5: 14 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Finished the applied visual design challenges and make a simple app using Django framework.

 **Thoughts**: Although I finished this section (applied visual design), a lot of training still needed in order to familiarise myself with the tools. Same with Django, it is an interesting framework where you could make dynamic webpage, but getting used to the available features will be a difficult task!

 ### Day 6: 15 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Finished the applied accessibility challenges.

 **Thoughts**: Today's section reminds me that you can't just try to make your webpage to be as fancy as possible, you need to make sure that they are easily read by as many people as possible, including those with difficulties (e.g. colorblind). Also, using the proper semantics in your webpage can make development easier.

 ### Day 7: 16 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Finished the responsive web design principles and CSS flexbox challenges.

 **Thoughts**: Again, today's challenges taught me some tools that can improve websites' readbility. It is really useful, and surprisingly there are lot of stuffs to learn and experiment to. Hopefully I can apply them on real projects as soon as possible.

 ### Day 8: 17 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Started doing the CSS Grid challenges.

 **Thoughts**: Not so much work today, hopefully tomorrow I can up the productivity!

 ### Day 9: 19 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Finished the CSS Grid challenges. Soon I can start the responsive web design project.

 **Thoughts**: whoopps.. Skipped a day bacause busy schedule, I am still in tho according to the rules :p, but hopefully next time I can still find time to coding.

 ### Day 10: 20 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Started working on the tribute page project from FCC. See this [codepen link](https://codepen.io/momoso7/pen/bGeyJZd).

 **Thougths**: I almost satisfy all the specification (or to borrow FCC's term, user story.) Hopefully it can be finished tomorrow. I need to recall many features I have learned before.

 ### Day 11: 21 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Finished the tribute page, for [Galois](https://codepen.io/momoso7/full/bGeyJZd).

 **Thoughts**: I used a lot of references, some good ones are W3Schools, mozilla developer, bootstraps. While this project was challenging, I think we don't need too many tricky code.

 ### Day 12: 22 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Started the survey form page, the next project regarding responsive web design.

 **Thoughts**: I already felt that this one is harder than the tribute page XD, can I finish this tomorrow?

 ### Day 13: 23 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Finished the minimum requirement for the form page, but I can still improve it, so I will try to do that tomorrow.

 **Thoughts**: Finally finished this one, although some parts are still unsatisfactory. Will continue tomorrow, but you can see the current [form](https://codepen.io/momoso7/full/yLJdGpN) here.

 ### Day 14: 24 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Started product landing page project. Not improving much of the already finished survey form.

 **Thoughts**: The progress is quite slow.. stuck doing the header, especially regarding the positions of the navigation bar. It's quite hard to grasp what is the difference between absolute, relative, and others.

 ### Day 15: 25 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Continue the product landing page project and trying to make a simple program in python.
 
 **Thoughts**: The product landing page is quite hard, but I almost fulfill all the user stories. Try to make a simple python program as a side project, it is more intended to refresh my memories regarding python's basic functions. I believe python will be useful later for web development.

 ### Day 16: 26 November 2020
**Today's Progress**: Finished the product landing page.

**Thoughts**: This one is quite challenging, but finally finished it! Like the previous project, it still can be improved, especially design-wise. The media queries that I defined also hasn't working properly when tested. I wonder what is the cause of this?

### Day 17: 27 November 2020
**Today's Progress**: Started doing the technical documentation page.

**Thoughts**: So far, everything goes quite smoothly. But reading the user stories, I think it will be a challenge to make the navigation bar. Let's see if I can finish this tomorrow.

### Day 18: 28 November 2020
**Today's Progress**: Continue technical documentation page, still not done, especially the navigation bar.

**Thoughts**: Besides the navigation bar, I think the page is going smoothly. Btw, this is the codepen page for the [product landing page](https://codepen.io/momoso7/full/dypbPbX).

### Day 19: 29 November 2020
**Today's Progress**: Finished the technical documentation page! But still can be improved.

**Thoughts**: The technical documentation page is working as intended, but it can still be dressed so it looks better and more comfortable to navigate. Follow the development [here](https://codepen.io/momoso7/full/zYKYyBb).

### Day 20: 1 December 2020
**Today's Progress**: Started the personal portofolio page. Edited the technical documentation.

**Thoughts**: Slow progress today, life is catching up. But no excuse! Will do better tomorrow

### Day 21: 2 December 2020
**Today's Progress**: Ramping up the personal portofolio page. 

**Thoughts**: For how many projects in a row? the navigation bar part is the hardest one! Finally, I successfully made a working media query.

### Day 22: 3 December 2020
**Today's Progress**: Finished up the personal portofolio page, yay!

**Thoughts**: Quite a challenge, but managed to finish it. I have finished the responsive web design challenge. On to the next one. You can find the personal portofolio page [here](https://codepen.io/momoso7/full/dypormj).

### Day 23: 4 December 2020
**Today's Progress**: Started doing the basic javascript challenge. Finally I tried this language.

**Thoughts**: So far, the syntax is feels similar to C++. Should be fun!
<!-- ### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
