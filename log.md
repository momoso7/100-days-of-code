# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 10 November 2020
**Today's Progress**: I managed to complete FreeCodeCamp's Basic HTML and Basic HTML5.

**Thoughts**: I spent almost one hour doing this task. Let's see what else I can do today.
 BTW, here is the link to my [FreeCodeCamp profile](https://www.freecodecamp.org/momoso7).

 ### Day 2: 11 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Finished the basic CSS section of FreeCodeCamp. Try to make a basic code related to what I've studied using [sololearn](https://code.sololearn.com/WeEcPOUQyc5x/#html)'s code playground.

 **Thoughts**: So far, the stuffs I've learned is quite easy to understand. But to use them correctly can be a little bit tricky. Even when making this simple code, I spent a few minutes tinkering stuffs, changing the values of parameters, it's quite fun!

 ### Day 3: 12 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Doing the applied visual design challenges in FreeCodeCamp. Unlike yesterday's challenge, I can't finish this in one go. I also tried to make a front-end page of Google search, but it hasn't finished yet.

 **Thoughts**: Trying to make a front-end of a page is intersting, as there are still lot of functionalities that I haven't learnt. Most browsers today come with the inspect element tools, so I am able to see the HTML codes used by Google, but I can't simply copy them.

 ### Day 4: 13 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Still working on the applied visual design challenges in FreeCodeCamp. Hopefully can finish today. It's quite interesting, how we can make some shapes like moons, hearts, and even penguin!

 **Thoughts**: Starting to feel the learning curve, eh? There are rich choices of styling for html, but at the same time, it's also intimidating. I am trying to make a [chessboard](https://code.sololearn.com/WtQ3ZYCO3nDE/#html) in sololearn.

 ### Day 5: 14 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Finished the applied visual design challenges and make a simple app using Django framework.

 **Thoughts**: Although I finished this section (applied visual design), a lot of training still needed in order to familiarise myself with the tools. Same with Django, it is an interesting framework where you could make dynamic webpage, but getting used to the available features will be a difficult task!

 ### Day 6: 15 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Finished the applied accessibility challenges.

 **Thoughts**: Today's section reminds me that you can't just try to make your webpage to be as fancy as possible, you need to make sure that they are easily read by as many people as possible, including those with difficulties (e.g. colorblind). Also, using the proper semantics in your webpage can make development easier.

 ### Day 7: 16 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Finished the responsive web design principles and CSS flexbox challenges.

 **Thoughts**: Again, today's challenges taught me some tools that can improve websites' readbility. It is really useful, and surprisingly there are lot of stuffs to learn and experiment to. Hopefully I can apply them on real projects as soon as possible.

 ### Day 8: 17 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Started doing the CSS Grid challenges.

 **Thoughts**: Not so much work today, hopefully tomorrow I can up the productivity!

 ### Day 9: 19 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Finished the CSS Grid challenges. Soon I can start the responsive web design project.

 **Thoughts**: whoopps.. Skipped a day bacause busy schedule, I am still in tho according to the rules :p, but hopefully next time I can still find time to coding.

 ### Day 10: 20 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Started working on the tribute page project from FCC. See this [codepen link](https://codepen.io/momoso7/pen/bGeyJZd).

 **Thougths**: I almost satisfy all the specification (or to borrow FCC's term, user story.) Hopefully it can be finished tomorrow. I need to recall many features I have learned before.

 ### Day 11: 21 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Finished the tribute page, for [Galois](https://codepen.io/momoso7/full/bGeyJZd).

 **Thoughts**: I used a lot of references, some good ones are W3Schools, mozilla developer, bootstraps. While this project was challenging, I think we don't need too many tricky code.

 ### Day 12: 22 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Started the survey form page, the next project regarding responsive web design.

 **Thoughts**: I already felt that this one is harder than the tribute page XD, can I finish this tomorrow?

 ### Day 13: 23 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Finished the minimum requirement for the form page, but I can still improve it, so I will try to do that tomorrow.

 **Thoughts**: Finally finished this one, although some parts are still unsatisfactory. Will continue tomorrow, but you can see the current [form](https://codepen.io/momoso7/full/yLJdGpN) here.

 ### Day 14: 24 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Started product landing page project. Not improving much of the already finished survey form.

 **Thoughts**: The progress is quite slow.. stuck doing the header, especially regarding the positions of the navigation bar. It's quite hard to grasp what is the difference between absolute, relative, and others.

 ### Day 15: 25 November 2020
 **Today's Progress**: Continue the product landing page project and trying to make a simple program in python.
 
 **Thoughts**: The product landing page is quite hard, but I almost fulfill all the user stories. Try to make a simple python program as a side project, it is more intended to refresh my memories regarding python's basic functions. I believe python will be useful later for web development.

 ### Day 16: 26 November 2020
**Today's Progress**: Finished the product landing page.

**Thoughts**: This one is quite challenging, but finally finished it! Like the previous project, it still can be improved, especially design-wise. The media queries that I defined also hasn't working properly when tested. I wonder what is the cause of this?

### Day 17: 27 November 2020
**Today's Progress**: Started doing the technical documentation page.

**Thoughts**: So far, everything goes quite smoothly. But reading the user stories, I think it will be a challenge to make the navigation bar. Let's see if I can finish this tomorrow.

### Day 18: 28 November 2020
**Today's Progress**: Continue technical documentation page, still not done, especially the navigation bar.

**Thoughts**: Besides the navigation bar, I think the page is going smoothly. Btw, this is the codepen page for the [product landing page](https://codepen.io/momoso7/full/dypbPbX).

### Day 19: 29 November 2020
**Today's Progress**: Finished the technical documentation page! But still can be improved.

**Thoughts**: The technical documentation page is working as intended, but it can still be dressed so it looks better and more comfortable to navigate. Follow the development [here](https://codepen.io/momoso7/full/zYKYyBb).

### Day 20: 1 December 2020
**Today's Progress**: Started the personal portofolio page. Edited the technical documentation.

**Thoughts**: Slow progress today, life is catching up. But no excuse! Will do better tomorrow

### Day 21: 2 December 2020
**Today's Progress**: Ramping up the personal portofolio page. 

**Thoughts**: For how many projects in a row? the navigation bar part is the hardest one! Finally, I successfully made a working media query.

### Day 22: 3 December 2020
**Today's Progress**: Finished up the personal portofolio page, yay!

**Thoughts**: Quite a challenge, but managed to finish it. I have finished the responsive web design challenge. On to the next one. You can find the personal portofolio page [here](https://codepen.io/momoso7/full/dypormj).

### Day 23: 4 December 2020
**Today's Progress**: Started doing the basic javascript challenge. Finally I tried this language.

**Thoughts**: So far, the syntax is feels similar to C++. Should be fun!

### Day 24: 5 December 2020
**Today's Progress**: Continuing the javascript challenge. Learning about string, arrays.

**Thoughts**: Actually, the syntax is more similar to Python!! So far, it wasn't very hard to follow. Hopefully I can intergrate javascript to websites soon.

### Day 25: 6 December 2020
**Today's Progres**: Tweaking javascripts again.

**Thoughts**: Try to understand the concept of function, local& global variables, and arrays through examples.

### Day 26: 7 December 2020
**Today's Progress**: Continuing the javascript challenge, using logic tools. 

**Thoughts**: Again, it felt similar to Python. Just a small difference in some syntax. I managed to make a golf score announcer.

### Day 27: 8 December 2020
**Today's Progress**: Switch and objects (still javascript).

**Thoughts**: Slow progress today. Managed to make a blackjack predictor, it's quite hard!

### Day 28: 9 December 2020
**Today's Progress**: Objects properties, nested objects and lists.

**Thoughts**: The challenge today is quite hard, and it is good to know that object definitions could replace switch cases.

### Day 29: 10 December 2020
**Today's Progress**: Make an update record function.

**Thoughts**: This is the hardest task yet. Spent one hour just for one thing!!

### Day 30: 11 December 2020

**Thoughts**: The last part is challenging!

### Day 32: 13 December 2020
**Today's Progress**: Start the ES6 challenge. Analysing data with pandas

**Thoughts**: The ES6 is an interesting aspect of javascript, looks like it would be hard to learn this. On the other hand, Pandas is very useful for displaying data in a natural way.

### Day 33: 14 December 2020
**Today's Progress**: Continue the ES6 challenge, learning about destructuring arrays. element search in pandas and logical operators.

**Thoughts**: The ES6 challenge is quite confusing! What should I do?! Meanwhile, the data analysis challenge is okay so far.

### Day 34: 15 December 2020
**Today's Progress**: Finished the basic ES6 challenges. For data analysis, refreshing my memories regarding if/else and boolean operators. I also learnt some features of numpy.

**Thoughts**: Start to understanding the basic objects of Javascript, such as class. There is also a weird feature, promise.

### Day 35: 16 December 2020
**Today's Progress**: Starting the regular expressions challenges. Continue to manipulate dataframes with logical expressions

**Thoughts**: Just an usual day ~~

### Day 36: 17 December 2020
**Today's Progress**: Contiune the regular expressions challenges. Manipulate dataframes, arrays with loop.

**Thoughts**: Today challenge is super hard. First time I am looking for hints to finish a challenge. Hopefully I won't get discouraged!

### Day 37: 18 December 2020
**Today's Progress**: Regular expression is difficult, slow progress on this one, but almost done.

**Thoughts**: The grouping is really hard, how we need to find pattern in a string sequence with limited syntax. Need to practice a lot for this one.

### Day 38: 19 December 2020
**Today's Progress**: Finally finished regular expressions challenges, but definetely need to revisit this one. Try to simulate hacker statistics in DataCamp.

**Thoughts**: Regular expressions (again) is a hard subject, but I can feel how powerful it is. It is able to process and match strings using just a few lines of code (sometimes just need one line)

### Day 39: 20 December 2020
**Today's Progress**: Start the debugging challenges on FCC. Trying some pandas basic on DataCamp.

**Thoughts**: Nothing to say so far, let's keep grinding!

### Day 40: 21 December 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finish the debugging challenges on FCC. Recalled some basic plotting tools on Python.

**Thoughts**: Debugging is important, need to be careful especially when dealing with loops (infinite loops is dangerous)

### Day 45: 26 December 2020
**Today's Progress**: Trying to master the methods to join data with pandas. Continue basic scripting in javascript.

**Thoughts**: Some of the basic scripting case were quite difficult. For example, the one where we need to test regular expressions from a variable. Need to check stack exchange for that one.

### Day 46: 28 December 2020
**Today's Progress**: Mostly joining tables in datacamp and playing around with jupyter notebook.

**Thoughts**: Jupyter notebook is very fun! Lots of interesting stuffs. The datacamp challenge is starting to be a little bit hard, again, hopefully I won't be discouraged!

**Today's Progress**: Still continuing the joining tables challenge in Datacamp.

**Thoughts**: Just continue my day as usual. 

### Day 48: 30 December 2020
**Today's Progress**: Finished joining tables challenge

**Thoughts**: Joining tables (merge,concat) can be a very useful tool, but there is a lot of options to do this, so I need to recognize which method to use.

### Day 49: 01 January 2021
**Today's Progress**: Getting used to matplotlib basic usages. Continue my journey in basic algorithm scripting of javascript

**Thoughts**: Hopefully this year is gonna be a good year. The javascript challenge is becoming harder and harder, my pace suffered quite a lot.

**Thoughts**: The challenge in javascript algorithm is so difficult, I need stackexchange more and more.

### Day 51: 03 January 2021
**Today's Progress**: Quantitative comparisons and statistical visualization in datacamp

**Thoughts**: Now I understand more the difference between bar chart and histogram. Also learnt some tricks regarding scatter plot. No time to do javascript related work today. 

### Day 52: 04 January 2021
**Today's Progress**: Finished the visualization with matplotlib challenge in datacamp.

**Thoughts**: Some interesting stuffs today, need to up the pace tomorrow

### Day 53: 05 January 2021

**Today's Progress**: Cleaning text and categorical data

**Thoughts**: I got more insights regarding what kind of problems that could arise when checking data. Also, assert is a powerful tool for confirming that our cleaning methods really did what we wanted. 

I never thought that I would met regex here, after learning it before in javascript.

### Day 66: 22 January 2021
**Today's Progress**: Try to clean some data, especially datas with missing values or inconsistent values

**Thoughts**: Besides coding, to clean data, you must have a good sanity check ability.

### Day 67: 23 January 2021
**Today's Progress**: Try to do record linkage

**Thoughts**: The world of data cleaning is so complex! This is like the more advanced version of joining data, where similar (but not exactly the same) values are considered, to participate errors in data entry (e.g. typo 'Jakarta' and 'Ajkarta')

### Day 68: 24 January 2021
**Today's Progress**: Learn to validate data from hdf data format. Reviewing a time series prediction model

**Thoughts**: I still can't understand the difference between hdf format and other formats, but the power of pandas is shown here, as whatever the format of the data we have, we can manipulate them using dataframes

### Day 69: 25 January 2021
**Today's Progress**: Exploring the distribution of data

**Thoughts**: Need to review the concept of cdf and pmf, but the methods we used mostly are from the previous works, nothing new yet. Maybe the norm object.

### Day 70: 26 January 2021

**Thoughts**: Reminded of some tools: plot and learnt a new tool in crosstab, resample

### Day 75: 01 February 2021
**Today's Progress**: Finish the Standford policing data. Does weather play a part in arrest rate?

**Thoughts**: This problem exercise is very useful. I learnt a lot.

### Day 76: 02 February 2021
**Today's Progress**: use read_csv to read data

**Thoughts**: I have used read_csv a lot, but I learn something new today, it has lot of attributes, it is very powerful!

### Day 77: 03 February 2021
**Today's Progress**: Working with spreadsheet again

**Thoughts**: Mostly focusing on how to import data in spreadsheet format with pandas.

### Day 78: 04 February 2021

**Thoughts**: Hmm SQL queries can be really complex!! It is easy to get into SQL, but definitely hard to master it

### Day 79: 05 February 2021
**Today's Progress**: Working again with JSONs and APIs

**Thoughts**: These data type are one of the hardest I have done so far. Definitely need to return to practice this one a lot. But they are super powerful, as I remember seeing some analysis contents on dota 2 subreddit, most of them were utilising valve's API.

### Day 80: 06 February 2021
**Today's Progress**: Relational databases using SQL

**Thoughts**: Diagrams are useful before we start coding our tables, they enable us to see the relations between variables clearly.

### Day 81: 07 February 2021
**Today's Progress**: Attribute constraints in SQL

**Thoughts**: Attribute constraints seems to be inconvenient at the first glance, but it will be good for our database in the long run because they ensue consistency in the data.

### Day 82: 08 February 2021
**Today's Progress**: Attending workshop on people analytics

**Thoughts**: Very interesting workshop, I learnt quite a lot. But the workshop is using R language, which I am not familiar with.

### Day 83: 09 February 2021
**Today's Progress**: Keys in SQL

**Thoughts**: Keys is an interesting concept, and defintely will use this a lot in the future. By the way, I was wondering what is the difference between datatype char and varchar?

### Day 84: 10 February 2021
**Today's Progress**: Foreign keys in SQL

**Thoughts**: We are trying to link a table with another table using foreign keys. It is important to implement foreign keys correctly, and to decide what to do in the case of violations of referencial integrity.

### Day 85: 11 February 2021
**Today's Progress**: SQL refreshment and time series analysis

**Thoughts**: Practice some SQL basic commands, and try to understand the time series analysis given by Algoritma (on January)

### Day 86: 13 February 2021

**Thoughts**: Woww... inner join in SQL so far feels easier than in python. But anyway, it is such a powerful tool!

### Day 87: 14 February 2021
**Today's Progress**: Outer join in SQL

**Thoughts**: There are many kinds of outer joins; cross join, full join, left/right join. Combined with inner join, we need to carefully choose which joins to use.

### Day 88: 15 February 2021
**Today's Progress**: Set theory clauses

**Thoughts**: Another types of joins!! There are semi and anti join. Many tools at our disposal. We also learn the set theory clauses which is, as shown in mathematics class, consist of UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT.

### Day 89: 16 February 2021
**Today's Progress**: Subqueries 

**Thoughts**: Subqueries most often appears on WHERE, FROM, SELECT (in that order, according to datacamp). SQL has a high celling, so much to learn!!

### Day 90: 17 February 2021
**Today's Progress**: Relational databases with Python

**Thoughts**: What we have learned yesterday regarding SQL will be applied to python. There will be some adjustments in syntax but it should be worth it in the long run. 

### Day 91: 18 February 2021
**Today's Progress**: Advanced queries in Sqlalchemy

**Thoughts**: Amazing! We were able to use sql functions such as count, sum, etc. and at the same time use more applicable python stuffs such as pd dataframe and pyplot. 

### Day 92: 19 February 2021
**Today's Progress**: Advanced SQL query

**Thoughts**: Actually these were all stuffs that I have learned before, just now they are in python syntax.

### Day 93: 20 February 2021

### Day 96: 24 February 2021
**Today's Progress**: Analysing reviews and apps data from android playstore

**Thoughts**: Interesting stuffs, and I also encounter some problems that lead me to a few debugging. Sometimes, all you need to do is restart and refresh repeatedly!

### Day 97: 25 February 2021
**Today's Progress**: OOP in Python

**Thoughts**: Class is a really useful features, and inheritence will be useful for large programs. 

### Day 98: 26 February 2021
**Today's Programming**: Topic modelling; semantic analysis; word cloud
